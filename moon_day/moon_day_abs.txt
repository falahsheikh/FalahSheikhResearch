This paper proposes an image classification-based technique to determine the moon's age in a synodic month from a lunar picture. 
Prior to this study, no image classification-based approach has been applied to determine the moon's age. Historically, mathematical methods have been employed for this purpose, dating back to the Babylonian era. 
Our approach utilizes CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to analyze lunar images. We utilized a pre-trained ResNet18 architecture for transfer learning, leveraging its pre-trained weights to adapt to the new lunar dataset. 
The dataset was collected from Nasa's moon phase and liberation website using the requests and selenium libraries. 
At the end, we trained and evaluated different models using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
